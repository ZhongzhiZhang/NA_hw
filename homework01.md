Q: Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.

A: The essential difficulties is refering to those difficulties is refering to the difficulties which are inherited from the very nature of the software developing. The specification, design, and testing of the conceptual construct in the software made up of the essential difficulties for software developing. One possible example of an essential difficulty, e.g. a bug in a financial system caused by a conflict in state/federal regulations on one type of transaction is a typical instance of essential difficulties.


Q: Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.

A: Accidental difficulties are refering to those difficulties that today attend its production but are not inherent, e.g. the Heartbleed bug in the OpenSSL protocol. discovered in 2014, is a very typical accidental bug becuase this buffer over-read bug is not something that is unavoudable.


Q: List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.

A: They are: complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility. 
Developing sofeware is complex because no two parts in a software are alike. Also the nuber of states in a large software is huge. Also, some of the problem the software is trying to descibe is intrinsically complex.Some problems in software developing is resulted from the complexity. Among them there is the lack of extensibility for some software because of teh complexity in the stucture of the software.
