Q: Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.

A: The essential difficulties is refering to those difficulties is refering to the difficulties which are inherited from the very nature of the software developing. The specification, design, and testing of the conceptual construct in the software made up of the essential difficulties for software developing. One possible example of an essential difficulty, e.g. a bug in a financial system caused by a conflict in state/federal regulations on one type of transaction is a typical instance of essential difficulties.


Q: Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.

A: Accidental difficulties are refering to those difficulties that today attend its production but are not inherent, e.g. the Heartbleed bug in the OpenSSL protocol. discovered in 2014, is a very typical accidental bug becuase this buffer over-read bug is not something that is unavoudable.


Q: List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.

A: They are: complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility. 
Developing sofeware is complex because no two parts in a software are alike. Also the nuber of states in a large software is huge. Also, some of the problem the software is trying to descibe is intrinsically complex.Some problems in software developing is resulted from the complexity. Among them there is the lack of extensibility for some software because of teh complexity in the stucture of the software.
Conformity comes from the fact that software developing needs to deal with lots of arbitrary situations. It is impossible to plan ahead for this arbitrary situations. one typical example is that the computer programmer needs to deal with the changes of requests from the product managers all the time.
Changeability comes from the fact that software is always under the pressure to change even after manufacturee.g. all online video games changed and patched from time to time after they were issued.
Software is invisible and unvisualizable. Also it is difficult to reduce the software into some certain disgrams.It is difficult to convey all the necessary details in a single big picture.


Q: Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.

A: A "silver bullet" means something to make software costs drop as rapidly as computer hardware costs do.Brooks believe that there is no silver bullet for software engineering because the major progress we made is in attacking the accidental problem. However, the major obstacle for software programming lies in the essential difficulties.


Q:In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.
A: 


Q:In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.
A: Abstractions means to get the very nature of the software that break the problem down into something that is understandable. Conversations are inportant because software programming is conducted for the people and by the people. To understand the request of the clients and to communicate within the developing team, we need conversations.Specification means to make everything into concrete details. Translation means that as a software programmer, one needs to interpret the software from one level to another level all the time.Iteration means that the software development needs to be conducted in a iterative manner. In this way we can always start from a milestone when smething is done.
